- **Connection Duration**: Test duration tracking and response time measurement

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Critical Security Issue: Insecure Host Key Verification ‚ùå ‚Üí ‚úÖ
**Issue**: The SSH client was using `ssh.InsecureIgnoreHostKey()` which completely disables host key verification, making connections vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.

**Fix**: Implemented proper host key verification with fallback strategy:
- Primary: Use `~/.ssh/known_hosts` file for verification
- Fallback: Custom host key callback that logs fingerprints and stores keys
- Added warnings for manual verification when needed

### 2. Incomplete SSH Key Setup Logic ‚ùå ‚Üí ‚úÖ
**Issue**: The `setupSSHKeysWithProgress` function had incomplete logic for handling cases where root doesn't have authorized_keys.

**Fix**: Enhanced SSH key setup with multiple fallback strategies:
- Extract current session's public key from connection metadata
- Analyze auth logs to identify key type used
- Fallback to copying all available keys from root
- Better error reporting for troubleshooting

### 3. Missing Validation and Error Handling ‚ùå ‚Üí ‚úÖ
**Issue**: Limited validation of server configuration and connection parameters.

**Fix**: Added comprehensive validation:
- Server configuration validation (host, port, usernames)
- Authentication method validation
- Connection health checks with keepalive
- Command parameter validation
- Session timeout configuration

### 4. No Connection Retry Logic ‚ùå ‚Üí ‚úÖ
**Issue**: Single connection attempt could fail due to temporary network issues.

**Fix**: Implemented connection retry with exponential backoff:
- Up to 3 retry attempts
- Progressive wait times between attempts
- Better error reporting for connection failures

### 5. Post-Security-Lockdown Connection Issues ‚ùå ‚Üí ‚úÖ
**Issue**: After security hardening, root SSH access is disabled but the system still tried to use root connections.

**Fix**: Implemented intelligent connection management:
- Pre-validation of app user connection before disabling root
- Automatic switching to app user after security lockdown
- PostSecurityManager for handling mixed root/app user scenarios
- Graceful fallback mechanisms for privileged operations

## Security Improvements

### Host Key Management
- Automatic creation of `~/.ssh/known_hosts` entries
- SHA256 fingerprint logging for manual verification
- Warning messages for new host keys
- Proper file permissions (600) for SSH files

### Authentication Security
- Support for SSH agent authentication
- Multiple key file fallbacks
- Validation of authentication methods
- Secure key extraction from current session

### Connection Security
- Connection health monitoring with keepalive
- Session timeouts to prevent hanging connections
- Proper session cleanup and resource management

## Security Lockdown Process

### Connection Management During Security Hardening
The security lockdown process now includes several safety measures:

1. **Pre-validation**: App user connection is tested before disabling root login
2. **Staged hardening**: SSH settings are applied incrementally with validation
3. **Automatic switching**: SSH manager switches to app user after lockdown
4. **Fallback handling**: Graceful degradation if connection switching fails

### Post-Security-Lockdown Operations
After security lockdown is complete:
- Root SSH access is disabled (`PermitRootLogin no`)
- All operations use the app user with sudo privileges
- PostSecurityManager handles privilege escalation automatically
- Connection health monitoring ensures reliable operations

## New Features and Capabilities

// Get or create connection with automatic health management
conn, err := pool.GetOrCreateConnection(server, asRoot)
if err != nil {
    return fmt.Errorf("connection failed: %w", err)
}

// Connection is automatically monitored and recovered
output, err := conn.ExecuteCommand("echo 'test'")
```
